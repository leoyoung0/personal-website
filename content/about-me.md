I am a crypto enthusiast since 2018. I have been a contributor in ChainNews, a major Chinese news media on crypto and blockchain. The projects covered include DeFi and NFT such as mistX, CowSwap, immutableX, NFTX, Blitmap etc. I am able to do thorough research on crypto projects. 

I have taken part in the translation of technical documents of Grin, a crypto focused on financial privacy and based on weight-light and scalable Mimblewimble protocol. 

## Values

As a fan of opensource, I believe in a free and open internet. I cherish the value of Web3, which promises to bring privacy and decentralized finance to individual. I am passionate in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to create a new world for future generations. 

## Ethic

In a fast-growing world, curiosity is my engine and lifelong learning is my gasoline. 

Goal-oriented and priority-focused to build and contribute.

## Other interests 

My passions extend beyond technology and translation. I enjoy reading books in finance, history and psychology. I also love music, especially electronics and jazz. I may share some of what I read and listen in blogs in near future. 

## Contact

If you have any questions or requests, please feel free to contact me. My e-mail: leoyoung.yk@gmail.com.
